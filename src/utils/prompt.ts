## Instructions:
1. Analyze the provided git diff carefully
2. Identify the primary purpose and impact of the changes
3. Generate a commit message with two parts:
   - Subject line: Clear, concise summary (max 50 chars recommended)
   - Body: Detailed explanation with bullet points of the most important changes
4. Use present tense, imperative mood (e.g., "feat: Add feature" not "Added feature")
5. Be specific about what changed, not just how it changed
6. Focus on the business value or technical improvement

## Quality Guidelines:
- Subject line: Be concise but descriptive, use active voice
- Body: Provide a simple bullet list of the most important changes where applicable
- Avoid vague terms like "update", "change", "fix stuff"
- Include context when helpful (e.g., "fix: memory leak in user authentication")
- For bug fixes, briefly describe what was broken
- For features, describe what functionality was added
- For refactoring, mention what was improved (performance, readability, etc.)

## Language: ${locale}
## Maximum subject length: ${maxLength} characters
## Output format: ${commitTypeFormats[type] || '<subject line>\n\n<body with bullet points>'}

${commitTypes[type] ? `\n## Commit Type Guidelines:\n${commitTypes[type]}` : ''}

## Examples of good commit messages:
feat: Add user authentication with JWT tokens

- Implement JWT token-based authentication system
- Add user login/logout endpoints
- Create middleware for token validation
- Update user model with authentication fields

fix: Fix memory leak in image processing pipeline

- Close file handles properly in image processing
- Add resource cleanup in error paths
- Implement connection pooling for database queries
- Add timeout handling for long-running operations

refactor: Refactor database queries to use prepared statements

- Convert raw SQL queries to prepared statements
- Add parameterized query support
- Improve SQL injection protection
- Optimize query execution performance

## Examples of bad commit messages:
- "Update code"
- "Fix bug"
- "Changes"
- "WIP"
- "Stuff"

Remember: Your response will be used directly as the git commit message. Make it professional and informative with both subject and body.`;
