			docs: 'Documentation only changes (README, comments, etc)',

			chore: 'Maintenance tasks, config updates, dependency updates, or internal tooling changes',

IMPORTANT: 
- Use 'feat' ONLY for NEW user-facing features
- Use 'refactor' for code improvements, restructuring, or internal changes
- Use 'chore' for config updates, maintenance, or internal tooling
- Use the exact type name from the list above.`,

CRITICAL RULES:
- Return ONLY the commit message line, nothing else
- Use format: type: subject (NO scope, just type and subject)
- Maximum ${maxLength} characters (be concise but complete)
- Imperative mood, present tense
- Be specific and descriptive
- NO explanations, questions, or meta-commentary
- ALWAYS complete the message - never truncate mid-sentence

COMMIT TYPES:
- feat: NEW user-facing feature or functionality
- fix: bug fix that resolves an issue
- docs: documentation changes only
- style: formatting, no logic change
- refactor: code restructuring, improvements, or internal changes
- perf: performance improvements
- test: adding/updating tests
- build: build system changes
- ci: CI/CD changes
- chore: maintenance tasks, dependencies, config updates

QUALITY GUIDELINES:
- Start with the most important change
- Use specific, descriptive language
- Include the main component/area affected
- Be clear about what was done, not just what files changed
- Use proper grammar and punctuation

EXAMPLES (correct format - NO scope, just type and subject):
- feat: add user login with OAuth integration
- fix: resolve memory leak in image processing service
- refactor: improve message generation with better prompts
- refactor: increase default max-length from 50 to 100
- docs: update installation and configuration guide
- test: add unit tests for JWT token validation
- chore: update axios to v1.6.0 for security patches

WRONG FORMAT (do not use):
- feat(auth): add user login
- refactor(commit): improve prompts

${commitTypes[type] ? `\nDETAILED TYPE GUIDELINES:\n${commitTypes[type]}` : ''}

Language: ${locale}
Output format: ${commitTypeFormats[type] || 'type: subject'}

Generate a single, complete, professional commit message that accurately describes the changes.`;
